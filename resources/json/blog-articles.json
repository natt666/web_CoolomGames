We realized that some of the surreal, \"fake\" interactions you see at funerals would fit perfectly into the chaotic world of <em>Dating Killmulator</em>. So, we moved the funeral plotline forward and made it the center of the episode.</p>",

            "<li><strong>\"Giving Condolences\" Minigame:</strong> We added a new mechanic where you have to choose how to give condolences to Cassandra. You can be respectful, awkward, or even try to flirt with her (please don't, you piece of sh*t).</li>",
